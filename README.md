# Home Page

(TODO: insert jpg of create post corner)

In the home page, you can post content in one of the following categories: "General," "Fitness," and "Recipe."
Users also have the option to add a message to their post, or add images to their post. 

```However, user photos cannot be saved because we don't have a backend yet.```

(TODO: insert jpg of sample user post)

You can like other people's posts, and other people can like your posts as well.
You can also comment on other people's posts, ```although comments don't have the ability to track like counts yet.```

(TODO: insert jpg of user's followers-following corner)

On the left, the user can see who they follow, and who follows them.
You can click on one of your followers or followees to visit their profile page.

```However, to go from another user's page to yet another user's page, you must double click (single clicking won't work yet) to visit their profile page.```
```It's also not possible to follow or unfollow users directly from the followers-following corners, since we don't have a Follow/Unfollow button yet.```
