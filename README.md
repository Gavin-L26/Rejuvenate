# What Libraries Did We Use?

- MaterialUI (to improve the appearance of the login page)
- Bootstrap (for the navigation bar and add image buttons)
- Chart.js (for creating bar graphs)

# Login Page

(TODO: insert jpg of login page here)

You can log into the user home page with these credentials:

- username: user
- password: user

Or the admin home page with these credentials:

- username: admin
- password: admin

```Currently, any error messages (e.g. blank field or incorrect credentials) that occur will appear as the contents of the username and password fields are updated, as opposed to after the user presses the login button.```

# Register Page

(TODO: insert jpg of sign up page here)

You can sign up for a new user account with these credentials:

- username: user
- password: user

You can sign up for a new admin account with these credentials:

- username: admin

```The same "instant error message" problem occurs as the login page.```
```Moreover, there is no "new email" field, confirm password field, or the ability to confirm the user's new password via a confirmation email.```

# Reset Password Page

(TODO: insert jpg of reset password here)

You can reset a user's passwrd with these credentials:

# Home Page

In the home page, you can post content in one of the following categories: "General," "Fitness," and "Recipe."
Users also have the option to add a message to their post, or add images to their post. 

```However, user cannot save uploaded photos because we don't have a backend yet.```

(TODO: insert jpg of sample user post)

You can like other people's posts, and other people can like your posts as well.
You can also comment on other people's posts, ```although comments don't have the ability to track like counts yet.```

(TODO: insert jpg of user's followers-following corner)

On the left, the user can see who they follow, and who follows them.
You can click on one of your followers or followees to visit their profile page.

```It's also not possible to follow or unfollow users directly from the followers-following corners, since we don't have a Follow/Unfollow button yet.```

# Profile Page

(TODO: insert jpg of left side of profile page)

On the left, you can view your profile picture, your bio, and your favourite activities.

At the top center of the page, you can view sample charts for your favorite statistics.
To see all of your statistics, click on the "See more of your stats" link.

```We haven't figured out how other users can see all of your statistics, or how you can all of another user's statistics yet.```

Below, you can see all of your posts you've made.
